# Large-Language-Model-Comparison-

**Code Explanation:**
- **Import Libraries:** This section imports the necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization. 
  - `numpy`: Provides support for numerical operations.
  - `pandas`: A powerful data analysis library used for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib.pyplot`: A widely used plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
  - `plotly.express`: An easy-to-use interface for creating interactive plots and visualizations.
  - `plotly.graph_objects`: Allows creating complex, customized, and interactive visualizations.
  - `plotly.subplots`: Provides a way to create subplots in Plotly.
  - `datetime`: A module in the Python standard library for working with dates and times.

- **Download Dataset:** The script reads the dataset (`LLMs.csv`) into a pandas DataFrame, which allows for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

- The `date` column in the dataset is processed to replace the full month names with their three-letter abbreviations (e.g., 'July' is replaced with 'Jul') to ensure consistent date formatting.
- The dataset is then sorted in descending order based on the `date` column, ensuring that the data is arranged from the most recent to the oldest. The index is reset to maintain a clean index structure.
- The unique list of `owner` names is obtained and sorted alphabetically. This list is used to iterate through each owner's data separately.
- For each owner (`ow`), a subset of the data containing only rows where the 'owner' column matches the current owner is created (`datai`).
- A bar chart is created using Plotly Express (`px.bar()`) where the x-axis represents the 'name' column, the y-axis represents the 'trained on x billion parameters' column, and the title of the chart is set to the current owner's name (`title=ow`).
- Finally, the interactive bar chart for each owner is displayed using `fig.show()`.

This script essentially processes the dataset, sorts it by date, and generates individual interactive bar charts for each owner of Large Language Models, allowing for easy visual comparison of their respective models based on the number of parameters they were trained on.
